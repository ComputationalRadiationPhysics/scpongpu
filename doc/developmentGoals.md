Development goals for SCPonGPU
========

SCPonGPU should be used to simulate the laser-ion colling in storage rings and traps.
The short term goals are to add the following features:

 - a **time dependent** external potential for trapping the ions
 - a laser-cooling force based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of exciting/deexciting the ions
 - a inter-beam-scattering force based on a Monte-Carlo approach (rest gas collides with ions)
 - a bunching potential V(t,s)

Additionally, a diagnostic system could be added for:

 - Schottky noise spectrum virtual detector
 - emitted radiation from the ion transitions
